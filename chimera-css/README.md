# 🦁🐍 ChimeraCSS

Classless CSS framework with a clean, soft and modern design inspired by [SakuraCSS](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) and [Marx](https://github.com/mblode/marx).

## 🤓 Why use Chimera?

Classless CSS frameworks is great for building a beautiful UI, without worrying about unresponsive and unaccessible elements. Chimera does the element-styling for you, which only leaves the layout to you. For building MVPs fast and building UIs without a designsystem; Chimera is a great framework.

## ✅ Goals

What we want to achieve with this framework is as following:

- 🔥 Easy to implement
- 👨‍🎨 Clean, soft and modern design
- 📱 Responsive by default
- ♿️ Accessible elements
- 🤝 Class overridable styles
- 🪽 Fast and lightweight
- 🎨 Theme based - Easy to customize

## ➕ Implement Chimera

You can implement Chimera into your private project by downloading the ChimeraCSS package and directly link to the Chimera.css file:

```bash
npm install chimeracss
yarn add chimeracss
pnpm add chimeracss
```

```javascript
import "chimeracss/build/chimera.css";
```
or by including this tag in your HTML header.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://unpkg.com/chimeracss/build/chimera.css"
/>
```

### Responsiveness

ChimeraCSS is built with responsiveness in mind. All you have to do is to ensure that your application is responsive when using Chimera, and to include the ``Responsiveness tag`` in your ``<header>``:

```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### Themes

Chimera has multiple themes: 

- chimera
- chimera-dark
- chimera-golden
- chimera-autumn
- chimera-blues
- chimera-plain

To use an alternative theme, change the filename in the import to the same as the theme. Here is an example of how to implement chimera-dark using the `node_modules` import method:

```javascript
import "chimeracss/build/chimera-dark.css";
```

What we want to achieve with this framework is as following:

- 👨‍🎨 Clean, soft and modern design
- 📱 Responsive by default
- ♿️ Acessible elements
- 🤝 Class overideable styles
- 🪽 Fast and lightweight

## ➕ Implement Chimera

You can implement chimera into your private project by downloading the ChimeraCSS package and directly link to the Chimera.css file:

```bash
npm install chimeracss
yarn add chimeracss
pnpm add chimeracss
```
```javascript
import "~/node_modules/chimeracss/build/chimera.css";
```
or by including this tag in your HTML header.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://unpkg.com/chimeracss/build/chimera.css"
/>
```

### Responsiveness
ChimeraCSS is built with responsiveness in mind. All you have to do is to ensure that your application is responsive when using chimera, is to include the ``Responsiveness tag`` in your ``<header>``:

```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### Themes

Chimera has multiple themes: 
- chimera
- chimera-dark
- chimera-golden
- chimera-autumn
- chimera-blues
- chimera-plain

to use an alternative theme, change the filename in the import to the same as the theme. Here is an example of how to implement chimera-dark using the `node_modules` import method:

```javascript
import "~/node_modules/chimeracss/build/chimera-dark.css";
```
